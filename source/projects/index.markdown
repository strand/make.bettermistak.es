## make.bettermistak.es ##
* No immediate improvements needed. Tweaks to stylesheets would be nice, but that sort of stuff can get endless.
* Regular posts **need to be scheduled.**

## Octopress ##
* Close and resubmit pull requests
** Pullquote plugin: implemented a left-aligning pullquote. **Status: [Pull Request][1] in review.**
** Blockquote plugin: made seperate [pull request][10]. Used the [branching guide][5], then work on the new branch.
* Sub-menu navigation (dropdown)? No idea how to implement or if the community would find it useful.

## Review Resources ##
**Review** the resources listed below, an hour or two a day.

### Resources ###
* [Learning Rails 3][9]
* [Rails Recipes: Rails 3][8] - Skimmed over section headings, need a decent refresher before using most material.
* [Javascript the Good Parts][7]
* [bash Cookbook][6]
