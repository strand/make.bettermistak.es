I've taken a break, accidentally and out of necessity, from maintaining this blog and learning as much as I can. I've been busy with work and life, and transitioning into my new apartment, which will finally be ready around September 7th–I hope. Work has definitely kept me busy, and I'm glad to be consistently working in Rails on a daily basis. But I don't feel like I'm learning anything new, and that lack of new knowledge has made me anxious and maybe a little bit mean. 

Aside: I went to Madison Ruby ten days ago. While there I met @taschistog and @joel?notjoel who are both new to Ruby. They both did something that profoundly impressed me–both tweeted about their first starts with Ruby. They asked questions and talked about beginner problems. I need to get that sort of enthusiasm for TDD.

I know that learning is to a developer like swimming is to a shark. If you're not learning you're dead in the water. And I feel like there are some true deficits in my skills. Particularly, though I've reviewed Rspec and Cucumber to some extent, I don't feel comfortable writing tests, let alone doing test-driven development. At work we don't test, like we should, and I get the sense that this is the case elsewhere too. Your team is under-resourced and tests slip in priority, and slowly the glacier of technical debt builds.

When I code toy projects, like [password-dynamo](), I often don't start with tests, I start with an idea and code towards that. If I were writing, this process would be akin to freewriting rather than outlining. When I come back to this code with an eye towards writing tests, I'm really not sure where best to start.

I don't write tests like I should, and I want support in this. I am still looking for the right way to learn this. Just sitting down with a book isn't going to do it, a book doesn't hold me accountable. I need help from my friends.
