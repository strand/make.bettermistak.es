Certificates

There was an uncharacteristic moment at Madison Ruby during their panel on teaching and apprenticing Rubyists. @j3 brought up a really interesting scenario, in which he was talking with the Veterans administration (check hoe that's spelled) and they expressed some interest in paying for Veteran's to receive training. The VA asked if he could provide Vets with a certificate, and when he told them no, the conversation stopped. Jeff asked the Madison Ruby if it would be so bad if he were to offer the Jumpstart Lab Certificate (presumably of completion of the course). And suddenly, the panel, which was moderated and had had no audience interaction, became panelists arguing with a shouting audience. The crowd was loudly against.

I had heard arguments against certification in the past, but I hadn't seen that it was such a strongly held opinion in the community, and that the Ruby community felt almost uniformly against certifying folks in the language.

And that disappoints me, as I will be starting a certificate program in Ruby on Rails in the October. I am pursuing this education because I believe I've reached the limits of self-teaching. I need to work in a classroom to level up. I'm paying my own way, but there are folks who can receive financial assistance in their education, from the military, the state, their work, or in student loans, who would not otherwise be able to pursue that education.

The argument against certification is simple. In other tech communities certifications started with good intentions, but quickly diploma mills (cert mills?) began offering certificates to folks who only completed a test. Thus, folks were able to bolster their resume by paying a fee and memorizing some answers to the test, while not learning the fundamental skills a certificate should ensure.
