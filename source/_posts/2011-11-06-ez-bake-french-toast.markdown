Today I made some yummy French Toast, and it was way easier then I had expected. My recipe is as follows:

>Preheat oven to 400 with a cast iron skillet inside. Whip the following with a fork:
>
>* a splash of honey whiskey
>* an egg
>* a pinch of salt
>* a large pinch of sugar
>
>Dunk two slices of white bread in the mixture, taking care to get as much bread as possible to suck up the egg. Let set for ten or more minutes.
>
>Place bread in the preheated skillet, and reduce the heat in the oven to 350. Cook ten minutes, flip, and then cook an additional ten minutes.
>
>Serve with jam or Nutella. If you need syrup, avoid anything doctored with high fructose corn syrup like _yersinia pestis_.
