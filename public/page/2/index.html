        <p><em>Make Better Mistakes</em> is the idea. We all make mistakes every day, even when our perfectionism has locked us into the paralysis of doing nothing. Doing nothing is often a big and repeating mistake. Aim to make your mistakes small and individual or iterating. Small mistakes give you faster feedback. Individual mistakes give you more unique experiences to draw upon. Iterating mistakes keep you on the path, but allow you to guide course corrections.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p><em>This was a jumble written on a plane, please forgive the incoherency.</em></p>

<p>Today I am flying from Guangzhou to Washington DC by way of Tokyo to interview for <a href="http://www.hungryacademy.com">Hungry Academy</a>. I feel like I haven&#8217;t updated this blog since I got to China. It&#8217;s been a very full January for me. The first two weeks here were culture shock and settling into our new home, the third week was minorly productive for me, I managed to study for 9 half-hour sprints before my aunt and uncle arrived in town for the Spring Festival.</p>

<p>I was also nervous as heck before my phone interview with Living Social regarding Hungry Academy. I managed to chat with them around 3:30 AM Saturday morning, China time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve touched down at Narita for two and a half hours, and thought it might be a good exercise to write out all of the books which I am reading at the moment and what I am getting out of them.</p>

<blockquote><p>  <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas — I&#8217;d read the intro to this several months ago and have been meaning to read it since. I&#8217;ve taken this plane ride as a chance to absorb it. I can tell already that this is a book that I will revisit as I advance in my career as a software developer.</p>

<p>  <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> by John Green — I&#8217;m a fan of Green&#8217;s YA fiction, as it handles the challenges of its genre extremely well, and aims to be fiction about young adults, not merely fiction to be consumed by a YA demographic. I just started his most recent novel which is about a young woman with cancer.</p>

<p>  <em>Non-violent Communication</em> by Marshall B. Rosenberg — My partner and I have been reading this book aloud to each other at night before bed. It aims to teach the language and practice of empathy for self and others. I have noticed that both my partner and I—we are both excellent communicators—have improved our empathic communication skills since we began reading it. I anticipate re-reading this book. Highly recommended for anyone who communicates in their day-to-day life</p>

<p>  <em>Them</em> by Jon Ronson — I read Ronson&#8217;s <em>The Psychopath Test</em> this fall and really enjoyed his pithy style and engaging non-fiction narrative. <em>Them</em> is an earlier &#8220;novel&#8221; about extremists in the late nineties and early two thousands. It&#8217;s not as good, as there is not as much connective tissue between the different types of extremists, but I look forward to seeing the parallels Ronson draws.</p>

<p>  <em>Rails 3 in Action</em> by Yehuda Katz and Ryan Bigg — Katz and Bigg do something very difficult extremely well: They have written an enjoyable to read introduction to Rails with a focus on test-driven and behavior-driven development using Cucumber and RSpec. This isn&#8217;t my first Rails book (that was <em>Agile Web Development</em>) but it&#8217;s the first one I &#8216;ve found fairly engaging. I could attribute that to a greater sense of patience with technical books, but I suspect it actually has to do with the pattern of development that the book is based around.</p>

<p>  The hidden bonus feature of this book is introducing you to test-driven development. Using Rails sometimes seems like a mystical art to me, but using Cucumber in particular has given me guidance as to what my next steps are. I will definitely be studying TDD in greater detail in the future, as introductory books lose me at times when they introduce how to do lots of things in a language or framework, but refrain from informing me clearly why I am doing it. The pattern of write test -> implement features -> run tests is infinitely reusable and will save me time as it leads me towards better practices.</p>

<p>  <em>Walden</em> by Henry David Thoreau — Classic book on holing up in the woods and living simply. Thoreau affirms my belief getting rid of my stuff or not getting stuff in the first place is one of the best things I can do to improve my spiritual and mental clarity. Choice quote: &#8220;As long as possible live free and uncommitted. It makes but little difference wether you are committed to a farm or the county jail.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on at the moment. I hope the interview goes well, and wish I&#8217;d been able to eat my uncle&#8217;s  <em>jiaozi</em> today.</p>

        <h3>SEA -> BEI</h3>

<p>I am on the flight to Beijing, after having moved out of my apartment and stored boxes with family and friends. Last night was a late one, drinking cheap wine on a friend&#8217;s futon with my partner at two in the morning, letting the cheap wine soak our systems which were already coursing with caffeine from nine in the evening coffees.</p>

<p>This feels risky. Every part of my body says the safe bet would have been to stay in Seattle, find a job, any job, and work that for a couple of years till something better comes along. Something better isn&#8217;t coming along. Maybe I just wasn&#8217;t looking hard enough, but it looked doubtful that satisfying work was coming my way, no matter how hard I chose to look.</p>

<p>I did make one good stab towards my goals this week, despite the madness of moving. I finished my application to Hungry Academy, an apprenticeship program sponsored by Living Social with instruction by Jumpstart Lab. I posted my application video and a code sample. The video was ok, I did several eight minute takes and the last one felt good enough. The code sample I chose was a pull request wherein I had altered some of Brandon Mathis&#8217; code from the Octopress Pullquote plugin. There are very few alterations to the code, but it is the simplest solution that works, and this choice of project will hopefully demonstrate that I am capable of reading other&#8217;s code and adapting it. Also, able to contribute usefully to existing projects.</p>

<p>I really hope I get in, though the time commitment the program requires, along with it being DC-based might force my partner and myself to live apart for five months.</p>

<p>I reflected on last week&#8217;s goals and what worked and what didn&#8217;t I recognize that the thing that I need to focus on isn&#8217;t chapters or pages read (though these may end up as good metrics) but instead I should begin to focus on hours spent studying. I think that next week I will attempt to read <em>Rails In Action</em> for 12 hours. Which means I&#8217;ll need to read for two hours and twenty four minutes each day. I believe this is a completely achievable goal.</p>

<p>The other part to making this work is recording a metric other than time to see if I can improve. Though not all pages are equal, I&#8217;m going to track my page count, so that in the future I can improve my pages read per hour or day.</p>

<h3>On the Ground in Guangzhou, Day Two</h3>

<p>We arrived in Guangzhou late at night, 10:20 PM China time. We subtract sixteen hours to figure out the time in the States. it was 5:20 AM  back home in Seattle. We are exhausted from running through the Beijing airport after one of our bags disappeared. Both my partner and I had small meltdowns in the airport, and she barely slept on the plane. My brother and his wife pick us up from the airport and we cross into the new year while riding the Subway from the airport closer to their apartment.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a shopping day, including a long and exhausting trip to IKEA. We&#8217;re crashing in the extra room in my brother&#8217;s flat until we can furnish the apartment we&#8217;ll be staying at in the building above my brother&#8217;s brewery.</p>

<p>I think that acclimating through the jet lag and minor culture shock is going to leave me low energy, and it&#8217;s already Monday evening. I&#8217;m going to set a realistic goal of eight hours of reading this week, two hours each day Tuesday through Friday. I&#8217;ll set aside time and space away from my family to make this happen and hopefully also be able to check in at the end of the week.</p>

        <p>This week I will move my stuff out of my apartment and fly to Guangzhou. This obviously leaves me with a lack of time to work on projects. My project this week is to apply to <a href="http://hungryacademy.com/">Hungry Academy</a>. I&#8217;ll write a post before Friday to report how that went.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/12/23/the-hidden-chapter/">The Hidden Chapter</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>I didn&#8217;t read five chapters this week, and that&#8217;s partially because of the hidden chapter in all tech books. I believe the hidden chapter is a bug, but in documenting it I hope to make it in to a feature.</p>

<p>Tech publishing firms deals with different issues than other publishers. Tech books have small audiences which leads to higher prices per book as the economy of scale is the only thing that makes a paperback a possibly profitable prospect. (Though most books make very little. The secret of publishing is making small bets on unknowns and then creating and maintaining audiences for authors who find an audience with their first book.)</p>

<p>Tech authors aren&#8217;t paid much relative to the compensation they can receive if they work as consultants. I don&#8217;t have any info to compare their wage to authors in other sections of the bookstore, but anyone who has enough expertise to write a good tech book also has enough expertise to find better paying work elsewhere.</p>

<p>They also have to strike a difficult balance, being entertaining without being overly verbose, being informative without dulling the reader into a coma. I have been routinely surprised at how well written the prose is in tech books, and it comes from a high attention to detail on the authors part, as well as the early readers of the book, who are generally uncompensated.</p>

<p>To prepare a book for printing the publisher must work in rigid formats which preserve layouts and encourage migraines. There may be some editing staff that review the prose, but the publishing industry has scaled down heavily on copy-editors and other related quality assurance staff as the industry has digitized.</p>

<p>This is all to say, <strong>mistakes are made in tech books</strong>. They are to be expected.</p>

<p>However, a small mistake can have large ramifications for a coder just learning a new technology. I&#8217;ve been working through Rails 3 In Action written by Ryan Bigg and published by Manning Books. This morning at six, after a night of insomnia, I began working through the third chapter. My PDF was generated earlier this week, or it was delivered to me at the least, and I assumed that any known errata would already be incorporated. It turns out this is not the case.</p>

<p>Instead, I had an issue with using a version of Cucumber that had come out since the book was released and breaks the functionality of the code I was working through. The error got me confused, and I decided to take a rest. After a two hour nap and some veggie huevos rancheros, I tried my hand at it again. I figured out that my issue was related to using the wrong version of Cucumber. I tried a few things to fix the version issue on my current commit, but ended up having to revert to an earlier checkin with git. And that troubleshooting process took me a couple of hours where I would have actually worked through the material.</p>

<p>I believe that troubleshooting problems is an important skill to have. Mistakes in tech books encourage the reader to learn how to troubleshoot. But they also encourage frustration. I wish that there were a good, simple solution to ironing out errors from tech books, even those errors that are introduced by changing technology. From my understanding, Pragmatic Programmers has much better errata reporting system then Manning Books. Reducing the errors by using print-on-demand and continuous development helps a lot, but it will never be a silver bullet.</p>

<p>Those hours you take to troubleshoot something that should work, but doesn&#8217;t, are the missing chapter in most tech books. Try to look at them as value-added content. And publishers, please try to keep the missing chapters in the second half of your books.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/12/19/new-habits/">New Habits</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>This week I am going to set the goal of establishing two new habits, first I will post to the blog on Monday and Friday of every week. The Monday post will be about whatever my goals for the week are. The Friday post will be a review of how well I achieved my goals. The second goal is to read at least five chapters of my current development book, <a href="http://www.manning.com/katz/">Rails 3 In Action</a>.</p>

<p>Today I made it through the first chapter of Rails in Action, which was an overview of using rails with the scaffolding generator. Nothing too surprising, and near the end of the chapter my eyes started glazing over. Tomorrow&#8217;s chapter is about Unit::Test, RSpec, and Cucumber, Test Driven Development, all that. The writing is pretty good, Technical books have to strike a difficult balance in that their information to page count ratio must be high, but their tone shouldn&#8217;t be too dry, and if Rails in Action were a sandwich, it would have just the right amount of mustard.</p>

<p>Other things going on this week include packing and Christmas. My partner has sorted through all of her clothes and is giving away three quarters of them. Our rolling duffels will arrive in the mail tomorrow. We&#8217;re eleven days from flying out, and the limitations of international travel make me examine what I really <em>need</em>. Not a lot, it turns out.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p><em>I&#8217;ve been busy prepping to leave town</em> is the lie I tell myself to excuse being unproductive in the last month. Our cultural obsession with productivity makes many into tools, but there are days I wouldn&#8217;t mind getting a few things off of my metaphorical to do list.</p>

<p>Reality is: I get stuck in dumb loops. I check twitter. I play civ5. I marathon DS9 on Netflix way past midnight. I check twitter, reddit, reader, facebook, and twitter. I look for dopamine fixes, and avoid sitting still without my wifi on for distraction. Why? as Tony Schwartz puts it in his excellent talk <a href="http://the99percent.com/videos/7110/Tony-Schwartz-The-Myths-of-the-Overworked-Creative">The Myths of the Overworked Creative</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s imagine you are looking at your computer and you are working on a very difficult problem and you know <em>anything that you can do to get away from that problem will be extremely attractive</em>, because human beings have two core impulses in life: number one, escape pain; number two, move towards pleasure. That&#8217;s where we live. So now, along comes the ping of that email, and that email is saying freedom, I&#8217;m free at last. And you go to that email because it takes you away from the pain of doing something more difficult and more complex, and it promises you a potential pleasure. It rarely delivers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/11/20/how-do-i-keep-secrets-while-sharing-code/">How Do I Keep Secrets While Sharing Code?</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>This week I&#8217;ve been working on a pretty simple Sinatra-based website which uses the <a href="http://twitter.rubyforge.org/">twitter gem</a>. I&#8217;m almost ready to post what I&#8217;ve got so far on github and heroku and see if anyone likes what I&#8217;ve made so far. But before I commit my code publicly, I want to ensure that my secrets are properly obfuscated. Below is a codeblock used to load secrets and keys into the application:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1381160.js?file=authenticate.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>require 'twitter'
require 'yaml'

def authenticate
  
  Twitter.configure do |c|
    config = YAML.load(File.read(&quot;config.yml&quot;))[:twitter]
    c.consumer_key       = config[:consumer_key]
    c.consumer_secret    = config[:consumer_secret]
    c.oauth_token        = config[:oauth_token]
    c.oauth_token_secret = config[:oauth_token_secret]
  end

  @client = Twitter::Client.new

end</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Correspondingly, below is the YAML which has the secrets, with my secrets stripped out:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1381160.js?file=config.yml'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>:twitter:
    :consumer_key:       CONSUMER_KEY
    :consumer_secret:    CONSUMER_SECRET
    :oauth_token:        OAUTH_TOKEN
    :oauth_token_secret: OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This is a fine way to obfuscate my secrets, but only if I never include the secret in my repository, which I can do easily enough with .gitignore. But, I only want to exclude this from my viewable source, not from my deployed application, otherwise my app won&#8217;t run. <a href="http://help.github.com/ignore-files/">Github&#8217;s help</a> indicates that &#8220;Local per-repo rules can be added to the <code>.git/info/exclude</code> file in your repo,&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t indicate how this info needs to be formatted. The guides to .gitignore I have found have all directed me to a broken man page for more information, I think I need the help of a professional.</p>

<p>So the question is: <strong>how do I make committing this YAML file conditional?</strong> So I never accidentally upload it to github, but it always shows up on Heroku?</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2011/11/13/on-optimism/">On Optimism</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>What traits make us better able to learn new skills? I think there&#8217;s a handful of qualities we can foster to make skill acquisition easier, but optimism may be the most important one.</p>

<p>Recently I began reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400078393/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sibrar-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1400078393">Learned Optimism</a>, which claims that pessimists are significantly likelier to stay depressed than optimists are. I heard about the book after stumbling on a talk by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/raganwald">@raganwald</a> on <a href="https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-05-01/optimism.md">optimism</a>.</p>

<p>The book is good. I&#8217;m about halfway through it, and have taken tests which determine wether you are an optimist or a pessimist, and wether you are depressed or not, I can tell you that I am a pessimist, but I am not depressed.</p>

<p>I am especially glad to hear the second half of that. I have had depressions come and go since my teens, and this year has had it&#8217;s ups and downs. If I didn&#8217;t do a good job of maintaining myself, I could find myself in a depressive funk which can feel like it will go on forever.</p>

<p>The pessimist part of the quizzes is accurate, too. I am inclined to look at what can go wrong, and prepare well for when it eventually does. I am anxious. I tend to overthink my problems when I have them. Right now I am worrying if I am taking the right tact in this blog post.</p>

<p>When we&#8217;re learning something new, it is good to have an optimistic frame of mind. Because, eventually, there will be a setback. My partner is less tech-inclined then I am, and when she runs into a problem that she cannot solve on the computer, she throws her hands up and says &#8220;I&#8217;m no good at tech.&#8221; It pains me to see her pessimistic approach to technology.</p>

<p>When bad things happen, like if our programming environment is near impossible to setup, an optimist explains it as being impersonal, specific, and temporary. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t my fault Foo++ 0.9 isn&#8217;t easy to install, but the next version should be easier.&#8221; When good things happen, like creating an app in a new environment, the optimist takes it as personal, general, and permanent. &#8220;I&#8217;m really smart, which is what made putting together my Foo++-based webserver so quick and easy. I&#8217;m going to try building a bigger app next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Optimism is the attitude we need to foster to better encourage persistent improvement, especially when (inevitably) things don&#8217;t go as planned.</p>
