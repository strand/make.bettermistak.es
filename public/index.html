    <div class="entry">
        <p>A business that chooses to train knowledge workers in whatever domain is in demand is likely to find that at the end of the day they have a competitive advantage. I think that you could start a small business today based solely on this principle and be a leader in your field within five years.</p>

<p>I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00850ZOKI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00850ZOKI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sibrar-20">Why Good People Can&#8217;t Get Jobs</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=sibrar-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00850ZOKI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> a short book by Peter Cappelli, and found his argument incredibly compelling.<sup id="refBody1"><a href="#refAnchor1">1</a></sup> For a variety of risk-averse reasons companies today make a practice of not filling job openings unless they have the perfect candidate. In the past, to fill a position which required special knowledge some companies would train promising candidates, but the nature of the jobs marketplace in the last few decades has made them overly-cautious of investing in training programs as they fear their employees will walk away after getting training.</p>

<p>For instance, a business that chooses to hire non-programmers and teach them to program will have a competitive advantage in their field. For this reason, based solely on the fact that LivingSocial started an <a href="http://hungryacademy.com">apprenticeship program</a>, I would place money on LivingSocial doing better than GroupOn in the next few years. LivingSocial recognized that without an influx of developers they wouldn&#8217;t be able to reach future business goals, and that it is cheaper to train devs than to (continually) recruit them.</p>

<p>I wonder if a web development consultancy cooperative could be formed based off of this insight. If you had a group of half experienced devs and half less experienced but dedicated trainees pairing together, you might find diamonds in the rough rather than paying market rates for diamonds. Of course, this sort of idea could be applied to any sort of business rooted in knowledge work, which is all of them.</p>

    <article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2012/05/20/birthday/">Birthday</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>On my twenty-ninth birthday I got let go from the job I had been on for less than two months. I was hired on at a low rate to move files between servers, and I decided to write a PowerShell script to speed up the process. I improved productivity by an order of magnitude. As in, my project manager told me &#8220;the guy who was doing this before you would do in a day what you&#8217;re doing in an hour!&#8221; They were really excited to have me working so efficiently that they gave me a raise, and I was glad to be tweaking a shell script to do this. (Incidentally, if you&#8217;re in a Windows environment, don&#8217;t use your own shell script to do this, run robocopy.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;d been unemployed for a long while, and I was just glad to be working again. And on top of that I got to program a bit–sure Windows PowerShell wasn&#8217;t my preferred environment–but it was great to fix a problem with some code.</p>

<p>And then they gave me the call. I was working from home the day before my birthday, and I had ended up taking a long late lunch with my partner. I had a shell script running at home. I was on the bus home when one of the recruiters at the consultancy called me and let me know that this was my last day. I brought in my equipment the next day, and that was that.</p>

<p>The only jobs I&#8217;ve ever been let go from were ones I didn&#8217;t like that much in the first place. In this case I accelerated my departure from the project by doing the work very effectively.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;[Developers&#8217;] principal work is human communication to organize the users&#8217; expressions of their needs into formal procedure. That work will be necessary no matter how we change the life cycle. And it&#8217;s not likely to be automated.&#8221;</em>
–<strong>Peopleware</strong>, Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister</p></blockquote>

<p>About a month ago, I started working as a web developer for Contour. This is the job that I wanted a year ago. This is the job I was hoping for while I was teaching myself Rails while visiting my family in Guangzhou.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really glad to be working where I am, I like the company and my coworkers and I find the work challenging. I&#8217;m planning to take the steps I need to really level up in this role, including taking a nine-month <a href="http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/ruby-programming/downtown-seattle-autumn-2011/">night course on Ruby and Rails</a> at UW. I&#8217;m finding it difficult to find the time outside my forty-hour work week to focus on self-teaching, let alone finding the time to contribute to open source. (My apologies to Ryan Bigg, I haven&#8217;t been able to review much of <em>Rails 3 in Action</em> at all yet.)</p>

<p>This struggle between work and life balance, it&#8217;s to be expected, especially when you actually have a life outside of work.</p>

<p>This weekend I turned thirty, and celebrated with barbecuing, beer, backyard reading, blueberry scones, and a new backpack. I&#8217;m beginning to figure out what I want to do with the one life I&#8217;ve been given, and I&#8217;m really glad to be working a job that I like. The weekends go by so quickly, and the workweek seems to move even faster. I&#8217;m blocking the time I can to learning what I can. And I&#8217;m really happy that I convinced myself I could teach myself to code well enough to be a professional, I think that it&#8217;s going to be a really satisfying career.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2012/05/03/how-to-create-a-local-sandbox-facebook-app/">How to Create a Local Sandbox Facebook App</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> this walkthrough only handles UNIX-y environments, like Linux and MacOS.</p>

<p>Facebook makes it easy to get started developing an app that integrates with their service, but I ran into a snag that confused me when I was trying to test my app locally. Here&#8217;s what I did to resolve the error below, which is thrown when you first try to log in on the Facebook Ruby-based app on localhost:</p>

<blockquote><p>{  <br/>
   &#8220;error&#8221;: {  <br/>
   &#8220;message&#8221;: &#8220;Invalid redirect_uri: Given URL is not allowed by the Application configuration.&#8221;,  <br/>
   &#8220;type&#8221;: &#8220;OAuthException&#8221;,  <br/>
   &#8220;code&#8221;: 191  <br/>
 }  <br/>
}</p></blockquote>

<p>To get started login to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">https://developers.facebook.com/</a> with your Facebook account and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Under Create a Facebook App, click on Developer App and Create New App, Name it (&#8220;Brony Finder&#8221;), Give it a Namespace (&#8220;og_brony&#8221;) and click the ticky-box for Heroku web hosting. I grumbled at having to provide a mobile telephone or credit card, and then moved on.</p>

<p>Select your environment and the email address you would like this Heroku app to be associated with, in my case, Ruby and strand@bettermistak.es. Your new app lives at <em>https://thing-stuff-1234.herokuapp.com/</em>. Mine was <em>https://electric-robot-2715.herokuapp.com/</em>.</p>

<p>Login to Heroku and head to &#8221;<a href="https://api.heroku.com/myapps">My Apps</a>&#8221; Click on general info and copy the git address under Git Repo. Go to the command line and in the directory you want the code to live in enter the following</p>

<blockquote><p>git clone git@heroku.com:electric-robot-2715.git <em># Clone your app.</em>  <br/>
cd electric-robot-2715/                          <em># Move into the app directory.</em>  <br/>
echo FACEBOOK_APP_ID=12345 >> .env               <em># Add your App ID to the local environment.</em>  <br/>
echo FACEBOOK_SECRET=abcde >> .env               <em># Add your secret to the local environment.</em>  <br/>
bundle install                                   <em># Install gem dependencies.</em>  <br/>
gem install foreman                              <em># Install Foreman.</em>  <br/>
foreman start                                    <em># Start Foreman.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser and click &#8220;Log In.&#8221; Oh no! you get OAuthException 191! This had me stuck for a few hours, and all I found were a few confusing Stack Overflow posts about it.</p>

<p>Facebook verifies that all requests for your app are coming from the right domain–they don&#8217;t allow requests from localhost or 127.0.0.1–and this info can be updated in your <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps">apps settings</a> under Hosting URL. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Add "local.herokuapp.com" to your Hosting URLs and save this setting. Then edit your `/etc/hosts` file so that local content is under the domain local.herokuapp.com. '>Add &#8220;local.herokuapp.com&#8221; to your Hosting URLs and save this setting. Then edit your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file so that local content is under the domain local.herokuapp.com.</span> This file is hidden, so from the command line enter <code>sudo vi /etc/hosts</code>. (Substitute your favorite editor for vi.) We need to use sudo, because this file is locked. Add the line &#8220;127.0.0.1  local.herokuapp.com&#8221; below &#8220;127.0.0.1  localhost&#8221; and save and quit your text editor.</p>

<p>Hit control-c and run <code>foreman start</code> again. Now test your app at http://local.herokuapp.com:5000/.</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>This afternoon I had an interview which I arrived twenty minutes early for. I wondered if they might have me do a demonstration of coding skills, and remembered that <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kerrizor">@kerrizor</a> is sometimes asked to use <a href="https://github.com/kerrizor/fizz-buzz">FizzBuzz to demonstrate competency</a> in interviews.</p>

<p>So while I was waiting in the lobby, I decided to generate FizzBuzz in CoffeeScript. This is what I came up with:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2141870.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>for number in [1..100]
    if number % 15 is 0

    else if number % 5 is 0
        console.log &quot;Buzz&quot;
    else if number % 3 is 0
        console.log &quot;Fizz&quot;

    <article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2012/03/14/the-rspec-book/">The RSpec Book</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p><em><a href="http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book</a></em> teaches how to build and refactor code using RSpec and Cucumber. I started it a few weeks ago, and set it down in preparing for my return to the States. I started it again last night and I&#8217;m glad that I was able to hook back in to the book even though I&#8217;d not looked at it or its code in more than two weeks. It is well written and approachable, written at a granular enough level that it is easy to set down for a while and not get lost when you pick it back up.</p>

<p>One thing that I am loving about The RSpec Book is that the chapters are short, and do a good job of guiding you through the process of building applications in a Behavior Driven Development style. Each chapter takes between twenty and forty minutes to complete, so even if your study time is constrained you can make some substantial progress.</p>

<p>At the moment I&#8217;m in the middle of the chapter &#8220;Refactoring with Confidence&#8221; in which the authors use a number of refactoring patterns outlined in Martin Fowler&#8217;s <em>Refactoring</em>. My roommate happens to have a copy, so I&#8217;ll be adding that to my reading pile and hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to find the time to start reading it soon. I am really enjoying the style of BDD, as its outside-in process helps me define the problem I want to solve, and guides me through the best ways to solve it.</p>

    <article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2012/03/08/realistic-goals/">Realistic Goals</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>I&#8217;m a little disappointed in myself for not posting anything in the last month.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been an exciting month too. My partner and I have returned to Seattle, and I&#8217;ve started working with mentors to establish myself as a web dev. I&#8217;ve been devoting time to studying an working on projects, and I&#8217;ve become a little more forgiving of myself if I fail to absorb all of the knowledge at once. In fact my primary goal at the moment is a simple and incremental one. I want to devote more time to working on projects and studying each week than I did the week before.</p>

<p>I think that is a realistic goal, because it assumes merely that I can do a little better than I did the week before, and I find it interesting that it is a relative goal as well. I had a realization a few weeks back when I was looking at a goal of reading a certain number of pages or working through a certain number of chapters. I found that I didn&#8217;t know what setbacks I would encounter, that it was difficult for me to estimate how much work I would be able to do in absolute terms, because there are always unforeseen roadblocks.</p>

<p>I can however, put in the time. So I&#8217;m going to try and work a little more every week and see what I can accomplish with a bit of incrementalism. I will eventually amend this goal to focus on increasing the quality of my work, but not until I&#8217;ve increased my weekly capacity from twenty hours of devoted work (which takes thirty to forty hours, I&#8217;m only counting the time my eyes are on the page or my brain and fingers are on the code) to about thirty hours a week. At that point I can be reduce certain less useful kinds of work but for now I just want to do better today than I did yesterday.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2012/02/03/what-are-you-planning-to-do-since-you-didnt-get-into-hungry-academy-just-curious/">What Are You Planning to Do?</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Yesterday an efriend direct messaged me: <em>What are you planning to do since you didn&#8217;t get into Hungry Academy? Just curious.</em></p>

<p>Good question.</p>

<p>I would like to find a junior web dev position, but the path from here to there is not clear to me yet.</p>

<p>My partner and I are looking at going back to the States, the culture shock has been especially rough for her and we both miss our community in Seattle.</p>

<p>On my window above my desk I have a post-it I wrote to myself yesterday, as a contingency plan for not getting in.</p>

<blockquote><p>If I don&#8217;t get into Hungry Academy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nicolemaddox">@nicolemaddox</a> for interview feedback and guidance.</li>
<li>Ask <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mathiasx">@mathiasx</a> to be mentors.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This has two parts with actionable steps that begin to chip away at two problems exposed by the HA application. The first problem is I have mediocre interview skills and this means that I only get mediocre jobs. Interviews are rare events that have a significant impact on my future.  Interviews are a game that I can increase my odds on, and I haven&#8217;t done a sufficient amount of work to get <em>really good</em> at answering questions like, &#8220;Where do you see yourself in five years?&#8221; An immediate next step to get better at interviewing is to solicit feedback from LivingSocial.</p>

<p>The second problem is I am still learning to code, and it&#8217;s going slow. I can continue to work on my own through whichever resources strike my fancy, but that&#8217;s a plan for slow-moving disaster. There are a lot of things I can work on, but I don&#8217;t have the judgement to know which things will be best for me at this juncture. An immediate next step to lay down the groundwork to improve my coding skills are to find mentors. Steve and Matt have both been awesome efriends, and I hope I can establish some checkins with them to ensure I stay on the right track.</p>

<p>Hungry Academy will be seeking applicants again, and if I&#8217;m on the market when they are, I will apply.</p>

<p>I also want to attend Ruby conferences, but there&#8217;s the chicken-and-egg problem of not having enough money to travel because I&#8217;m unemployed, and thus not being able to make the connections which could lead to employment because I can&#8217;t justify travel.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s looking likely that we&#8217;ll be back in Seattle before the end of February, and I will be looking for work to support our household. I hope that I can find a part time position to allow me to continue learning web tech until I am more qualified for development roles.</p>

<p>TL;DR Keep trying, hope I don&#8217;t run out of money too quickly.</p>

        <p><em>Make Better Mistakes</em> is the idea. We all make mistakes every day, even when our perfectionism has locked us into the paralysis of doing nothing. Doing nothing is often a big and repeating mistake. Aim to make your mistakes small and individual or iterating. Small mistakes give you faster feedback. Individual mistakes give you more unique experiences to draw upon. Iterating mistakes keep you on the path, but allow you to guide course corrections.</p>

        <p><em>This was a jumble written on a plane, please forgive the incoherency.</em></p>

<p>Today I am flying from Guangzhou to Washington DC by way of Tokyo to interview for <a href="http://www.hungryacademy.com">Hungry Academy</a>. I feel like I haven&#8217;t updated this blog since I got to China. It&#8217;s been a very full January for me. The first two weeks here were culture shock and settling into our new home, the third week was minorly productive for me, I managed to study for 9 half-hour sprints before my aunt and uncle arrived in town for the Spring Festival.</p>

<p>I was also nervous as heck before my phone interview with Living Social regarding Hungry Academy. I managed to chat with them around 3:30 AM Saturday morning, China time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve touched down at Narita for two and a half hours, and thought it might be a good exercise to write out all of the books which I am reading at the moment and what I am getting out of them.</p>

<blockquote><p>  <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas — I&#8217;d read the intro to this several months ago and have been meaning to read it since. I&#8217;ve taken this plane ride as a chance to absorb it. I can tell already that this is a book that I will revisit as I advance in my career as a software developer.</p>

<p>  <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> by John Green — I&#8217;m a fan of Green&#8217;s YA fiction, as it handles the challenges of its genre extremely well, and aims to be fiction about young adults, not merely fiction to be consumed by a YA demographic. I just started his most recent novel which is about a young woman with cancer.</p>

<p>  <em>Non-violent Communication</em> by Marshall B. Rosenberg — My partner and I have been reading this book aloud to each other at night before bed. It aims to teach the language and practice of empathy for self and others. I have noticed that both my partner and I—we are both excellent communicators—have improved our empathic communication skills since we began reading it. I anticipate re-reading this book. Highly recommended for anyone who communicates in their day-to-day life</p>

<p>  <em>Them</em> by Jon Ronson — I read Ronson&#8217;s <em>The Psychopath Test</em> this fall and really enjoyed his pithy style and engaging non-fiction narrative. <em>Them</em> is an earlier &#8220;novel&#8221; about extremists in the late nineties and early two thousands. It&#8217;s not as good, as there is not as much connective tissue between the different types of extremists, but I look forward to seeing the parallels Ronson draws.</p>

<p>  <em>Rails 3 in Action</em> by Yehuda Katz and Ryan Bigg — Katz and Bigg do something very difficult extremely well: They have written an enjoyable to read introduction to Rails with a focus on test-driven and behavior-driven development using Cucumber and RSpec. This isn&#8217;t my first Rails book (that was <em>Agile Web Development</em>) but it&#8217;s the first one I &#8216;ve found fairly engaging. I could attribute that to a greater sense of patience with technical books, but I suspect it actually has to do with the pattern of development that the book is based around.</p>

<p>  The hidden bonus feature of this book is introducing you to test-driven development. Using Rails sometimes seems like a mystical art to me, but using Cucumber in particular has given me guidance as to what my next steps are. I will definitely be studying TDD in greater detail in the future, as introductory books lose me at times when they introduce how to do lots of things in a language or framework, but refrain from informing me clearly why I am doing it. The pattern of write test -> implement features -> run tests is infinitely reusable and will save me time as it leads me towards better practices.</p>

<p>  <em>Walden</em> by Henry David Thoreau — Classic book on holing up in the woods and living simply. Thoreau affirms my belief getting rid of my stuff or not getting stuff in the first place is one of the best things I can do to improve my spiritual and mental clarity. Choice quote: &#8220;As long as possible live free and uncommitted. It makes but little difference wether you are committed to a farm or the county jail.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on at the moment. I hope the interview goes well, and wish I&#8217;d been able to eat my uncle&#8217;s  <em>jiaozi</em> today.</p>
