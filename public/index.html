  <div class="entry-content"><p>What traits make us better able to learn new skills? I think there&#8217;s a handful of qualities we can foster to make skill acquisition easier, but optimism may be the most important one.</p>

<p>Recently I began reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400078393/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sibrar-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1400078393">Learned Optimism</a>, which claims that pessimists are significantly likelier to stay depressed than optimists are. I heard about the book after stumbling on a talk by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/raganwald">@raganwald</a> on <a href="https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-05-01/optimism.md">optimism</a>.</p>

<p>The book is good. I&#8217;m about halfway through it, and have taken tests which determine wether you are an optimist or a pessimist, and wether you are depressed or not, I can tell you that I am a pessimist, but I am not depressed.</p>

<p>I am especially glad to hear the second half of that. I have had depressions come and go since my teens, and this year has had it&#8217;s ups and downs. If I didn&#8217;t do a good job of maintaining myself, I could easily find myself in another depressive funk which might feel like it could go on forever.</p>

<p>The pessimist part of the quizzes is accurate, too. I am inclined to look at what can go wrong, and prepare well for when it eventually does. I am anxious, and tend to overthink my problems when I have them. Right now I am worrying if I am taking the right tact in this blog post.</p>

<p>When we&#8217;re learning something new, it is good to have an optimistic frame of mind. Because, eventually, there will be a setback. My partner, who is less tech-inclined then I am, and when she runs into a problem that she cannot solve on the computer, she throws her hands up and says &#8220;I&#8217;m no good at tech.&#8221; It pains me to see this. And it is a pessimistic approach to technology.</p>

<p>When bad things happen, like if our programming environment is near impossible to setup, an optimist explains it as being impersonal, specific, and temporary. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t my fault Foo++ 0.9 isn&#8217;t easy to install, but the next version should be easier.&#8221; When good things happen, like creating an app in a new environment, the optimist takes it as personal, general, and permanent. &#8220;I&#8217;m really smart, which is what made putting together my Foo++-based webserver so quick and easy. I&#8217;m going to try building a bigger app next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Optimism is the attitude we need to foster to better encourage persistent improvement, especially when (inevitably) things don&#8217;t go as planned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Note: <a href="http://zfer.us/eyf1n">Code School</a> provides me a referral fee if folks sign up through some links in this post. Even without this fee, I would recommend their service.</em></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like webinars on the face of it, though perhaps I am judging a book by its cover. My experience with them is that a webinar will be a series of videos where someone captures their screen and drones narration while they perform some sort of boring task in whatever technology they are trying to demonstrate. Which, for me at least, isn&#8217;t a great way to learn something.</p>

<p>Recently, I tried <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> recently and I  enjoyed it. At first glance, Rails for Zombies appears to be a webinar, but it is really a well produced course. The course is led by Gregg Pollack, and all of the slides used are available as a PDF. After each video there is a level—a short quiz with a series of challenges which tests your knowledge of the material. <span class='pullquote-left' data-pullquote='I know I am making progress with these small, well-defined challenges.'>I know I am making progress with these small, well-defined challenges.</span> The mix of questions is pretty good, with some being pretty easy to grok, while others require a few minutes of reviewing the material.</p>

<p>This course is thrown together for free by <a href="http://zfer.us/eyf1n">Code School</a>, which has several courses on Ruby, JQuery, HTML5 and CSS3, as well as the Rails course. Once you&#8217;ve completed the Rails for Zombies course they give you a five dollar credit to &#8220;enroll&#8221; in the school, at a cost of 25$ per month. Which is a bargain if you consider the courses individually are priced at 55$ apiece.<sup id="refBody1"><a href="#refAnchor1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I had such a good time using the free version of Rails for Zombies that I have signed up for Code School and I am working on the second attack Rails for Zombies 2. These courses are a fun and engaging way to learn (or review) the basics of creating webapps in a Rails environment, and I&#8217;m going to see how much I can get done in the next month, then likely freeze my subscription. I like Code School a lot, but they&#8217;re currently only putting out a course a month, and I&#8217;m currently trying to keep my bills at a minimum.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="refAnchor1">
<p>I recognize this cost comparison is actually good marketing. Anyone who considers the monthly charge or the single-time fee will sign on for the subscription, and subscription services left uncanceled are more profitable than the purchase of products from time to time. <a href="#refBody1"  class='footnoteBackLink'  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I made some yummy French Toast, and it was way easier then I had expected. My recipe is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Preheat oven to 400 with a cast iron skillet inside. Whip the following with a fork:</p>

<ul>
<li>a splash of honey whiskey</li>
<li>an egg</li>
<li>a pinch of salt</li>
<li>a large pinch of sugar</li>
</ul>


<p>Dunk two slices of white bread in the mixture, taking care to get as much bread as possible to suck up the egg. Let set for ten or more minutes.</p>

<p>Place bread in the preheated skillet, and reduce the heat in the oven to 350. Cook ten minutes, flip, and then cook an additional ten minutes.</p>

<p>Serve with jam or Nutella. If you need syrup, avoid anything doctored with high fructose corn syrup like <em>yersinia pestis</em>.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I was cleaning out my music collection… I know, not the most interesting Saturday night, but over the last decade my collection has gotten a little hairy.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also grown to the size that pruning it by hand with Finder is nearly impossible.</p>

<p>Initially, I just wanted to find some files which had been accidentally duplicated. There were folders with a bunch of songs titled <strong>file.mp3</strong> and <strong>file 1.mp3</strong>. My first stab at this had me listing files and then filtering them by piping them to grep, and yielded commands that looked like this <strong>ls -Rd | grep -i &#8217; 1.mp3&#8217;</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve made a few pull requests on Octopress, which is the blogging platform this blog uses. The primary reason I was making the pull requests, oddly enough, was to get a sense of how the process of making changes and improvements on github works. One of the things I picked up from it was a better understanding of the use and nuance of git.</p>

<p>The three pull requests I made were:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/215">Pullquote left</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/220">Blockquote improvement</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/233">Alternate read more link text</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The first request got approved, the second is languishing with no current action, and the third got quickly requested, with an excellent conversation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Contracts end. Sometimes they end a little more abruptly then one might like.</p>

<p>I was working as a production specialist at Microsoft until recently. Nine days ago, at a Monday
 morning one-on-one, my manager asked me if I wanted to be doing the work. I don&#8217;t make a habit of lying, and I had to say &#8220;not really.&#8221; In the conversation that unfolded we determined what I would do to wrap up my work that day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I believe my attention, time, and money are the most valuable resources I have. Actually, I think it all comes down to my attention, what I choose to pay attention to and care about, but my time and money are the commonly traded commodities that let me pay more attention to things.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m feeling really low resource these days. I&#8217;ve got a full life. I started a new job three months ago. I&#8217;m building a domestic life with my partner and cohabitator. I also try to make time to socialize. And somehow, coding and writing get thrown under the bus because at the end of the day I&#8217;d rather poke the internet while watching TNG with my partner then try to build something new while working with stress and tension. Of course, researchers have found that for the sort of creative work I do, one can only create quality solutions if they are well rested.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello, internet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just getting this blog up and running, and I hope that it will be a good place for me to learn more about the tech I want to use. This blog is running octopress on heroku, and I&#8217;m generally interested in improving my Ruby and Rails expertise, getting better at bash, understanding git, and a ton of other advanced-beginner-level open source web development related lines of inquiry.</p>
