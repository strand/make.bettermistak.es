<p>Hello, internet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just getting this blog up and running, and I hope that it will be a good place for me to learn more about the tech I want to use. This blog is running octopress on heroku, and I&#8217;m generally interested in improving my Ruby and Rails expertise, getting better at bash, understanding git, and a ton of other advanced-beginner-level open source web development related lines of inquiry.</p>

<p>Below is a summary, notes to self, about how I got this thing up and running.</p>

<p>Today I successfully launched <a href="http://make.bettermistak.es">make.bettermistak.es</a>. I followed the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">setup guide</a> for a fresh octopress install, then used the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/heroku/">deploying to heroku guide</a> to get it on to a host. I then followed heroku&#8217;s <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains">custom domain guide</a> to setup my main domain.</p>

<p>TODO ensure that www.bettermistak.es, bettermistak.es, and *.bettermistak.es redirect to make. I think I can use <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains#redirecting_traffic_to_a_specific_domain">redirecting traffic to a specific domain</a> to do so. # TODO: Move todo to a non-content location so it is not copied three times.</p>

<p>Then, after composing this post, I ran <strong>rake generate</strong>, mentioned in the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">blogging guide</a>, to make the markdown into HTML. After that <strong>git add .</strong>, <strong>git commit -m &#8216;first post!&#8217;</strong>, and <strong>git push heroku master</strong> to upload it to the web.</p>
