    <div class="entry"><p>Last night I was cleaning out my music collection… I know, not the most interesting Saturday night, but over the last decade my collection has gotten a little hairy.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also grown to the size that pruning it by hand with Finder is nearly impossible.</p>

<p>Initially, I just wanted to find some files which had been accidentally duplicated. There were folders with a bunch of songs titled <strong>file.mp3</strong> and <strong>file 1.mp3</strong>. My first stab at this had me listing files and then filtering them by piping them to grep, and yielded commands that looked like this <strong>ls -Rd | grep -i &#8217; 1.mp3&#8217;</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After some filtering like that for a while I realized that find might be a better tool for the job.</p>

<p>I looked at find and ran several test  to figure out what I wanted. I came up with <strong>find /Volumes/Strand/iTunes\ Music/Music\ Archive/ -type f -iname &#8216;* 1.MP3&#8217; -exec rm -f {} \;</strong> which finds all the files in my Music Archive which have the case-insensitive suffix of &#8216;1.mp3&#8217;, and when it finds them, it removes them with force, that is, it deletes the files without checking with me first.</p>

<p>After feeling the immense power of find I couldn&#8217;t stop. I had to delete empty directories with <strong>find /Volumes/Strand/iTunes\ Music/Music\ Archive/ -type d -empty -exec rm -f {} \;</strong></p>

<p>Then, I got curious, which was my first mistake. Could I come up with something that would find all of the directories with folders with just one file in them? After all, my archive was cluttered up with plenty of one-hit wonders. To figure out how many files a directory has you can run <strong>ls -1 | wc -l</strong>. Which is to say, list all of the files in the current directory, each on a line, then pipe the results into the word count tool which is set to count the number of lines.</p>

<p>I experimented with using these commands in the -exec argument on find, but I ran into errors indicating that I needed to have a better understanding of bash fu to solve this problem.</p>

<p>So I went out for pho. When I got back to my apartment this problem was still tickling my brain, so I went to the bash IRC and asked for some advice.</p>

<p>With their help, I eventually ran <strong>time find /Volumes/Strand/iTunes\ Music/Music\ Archive/ -type d -exec bash -c &#8216;cd &#8220;$1&#8221;; f=(<em>); (( ${#f[</em>]} == 1 )) &amp;&amp; [[ -f $f ]] &amp;&amp; echo &#8220;$1&#8221; >> ~/Code/singletons.txt&#8217; _ {} \; &amp;&amp; say &#8220;I&#8217;m done&#8221;</strong> which listed out all of the singletons in a text file for me. Though I must admit this incantation is voodoo to me. This is likely a problem which a shell script, rather than a one-liner, would be more apt to solve.</p>

<p>It was plenty fun to play around in the shell, I hope that next time I&#8217;m better able to puzzle out quickly which commands are useful.</p>

<p>Lessons learned: bash is a great music management tool, if you don&#8217;t mind pruning your collection with the Swiss Army chainsaw, the bash IRC is friendly and active, and appending &#8220;; say &#8216;Imdone&#8217;&#8221; to commands that run more than ten seconds will save your sanity.</p>
