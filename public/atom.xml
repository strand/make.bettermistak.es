    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with connecting to a remote server using my iPad in the last few days. I&#8217;m curious if I can develop without a laptop. It&#8217;s an interesting constraint to work within. Other accounts of using an iPad and a remote server to develop, like <a href="yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad">I swapped my laptop for an iPad+Linode</a>, sold me on the possibility of developing on the iPad ages ago. This weekend I thought I&#8217;d try it out.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/zspencer">@zspencer</a> recommended Digital Ocean* as a quick to setup VPS, and Prompt and iSSH as iPad apps that give me an ssh terminal. Yesterday I set up a Droplet, Digital Ocean&#8217;s name for a remote server. Basically, I gave them a credit card number, clicked a button, and a minute later I had a remote Ubuntu box reserved for me, an IP address, and a root password.</p>

<p>Since then I&#8217;ve played around with working on that machine just through the iPad. I cheated once, last night when I wanted to add my remote box&#8217;s SSH key to github and I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to copy the key from the command line into my iPad&#8217;s clipboard.</p>

<p>My web development toolkit on a computer requires me to use a shell, a browser, and a text editor. From the iPad I&#8217;ve got the shell. I can use vi for text editing, but it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve got practice with, yet. The trickiest thing is getting a browser going while I&#8217;m in the development environ. One route would be to treat the remote server as a staging server. I could write code in vi, administer in the shell, then load the site up in a browser on the iPad. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t want mid-commit work to be staged, I just want to be able to view it.</p>

<p>What I want is to be able to go from the Ubuntu terminal to a GUI environ and look at the site in a browser running on the server. iSSH has a VPN option, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get it working this afternoon. In fact I remembered something about X, the linux GUI, and thought I needed to start up xterm. Looking at it now I realize I need to start <strong>X</strong> not <strong>xterm</strong> which is a terminal program.</p>

<p>The experience reminds me a bit of the first time I worked with Linux. I ended up installing Red Hat on a Compaq box my family had stopped using. I got the terminal running, but I couldn&#8217;t ever figure out how to get a GUI running, despite skimming over a thousand page how to use Linux tome I&#8217;d ordered from Powell&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t think I touched Linux again for another six or eight years.</p>

<p>Anyhow, getting a GUI running in iSSH is clearly my next step, but I also need to figure out if this is the time to level up my vim-fu or figure out how to use Sublime Text in a remote version of Ubuntu. Neither is a particularly terrible option.</p>

<p>One other thing I need to figure out sooner rather than later is how to create a non-root user with the correct permissions to create files, install programs, and make things go. I&#8217;ve done a little remote server administration, but most of it has been following recipes written by other developers, and I can&#8217;t remember what needs a chmod.</p>

<p>Have you used a remote system to develop? How did you level up? What resources were useful for you? (And how do I get my GUI running? Work with an account other than root?)</p>

<hr />

<p><small>* Digital Ocean is just one of many VPS providers. Others include Linode, Amazon VPS, and Slicehost. I don&#8217;t have any strong opinions about any of these providers, they all give you access to a server you can administer remotely for about the same price as a cup or two of fancy coffee a month.</small></p>

    <link href="http://make.bettermistak.es/2013/05/13/blogging-is-hard/"/>

    <id>http://make.bettermistak.es/2013/05/13/blogging-is-hard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello Internet,</p>

<p>I started this blog about a year and a half ago, when I was just starting to pursue a career in development. I&#8217;ve done an alright job with it, but let&#8217;s be honest, I haven&#8217;t posted much lately and this thing is getting a little moss growing on the North side from a lack of forward movement.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no stranger to sharing my writing on the Internet, after all, I had a livejournal back in the day. However, blogging hasn&#8217;t been holding my attention, because for a small blog like mine it&#8217;s not holding anyone else&#8217;s attention. When I write, I want to write for an audience, and even though people read this, it doesn&#8217;t feel like enough.</p>

<p>On Saturday, as my technical book club was wrapping up, I said something funny, and <a href="http://zeespencer.com/">Zee</a> indicated interest in subscribing to my newsletter. &#8220;Hrmm,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;maybe a newsletter is what I need to write to write again.&#8221;</p>

<p>And but so, I am starting a newsletter called <strong>Open Source and Feelings</strong>. I expect it to be more conversational and scattershot than my blog posts, and I&#8217;ll be putting out the first one near the end of May. Expect excerpts and responses to online articles and a bit of editorial on my part. It&#8217;s a letter from me to you, a place to start conversations.</p>

<p><strong>Make Better Mistakes</strong> isn&#8217;t going away, but posts will continue to be infrequent, and I will post to the blog when I have a one thing to say on a topic.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Your Pal from the Internet,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I left Ruby on Ales a few weeks ago I was sad, sad that I didn&#8217;t hug a few colleagues, sad that we only got a few words in with each other. I was sad that our time together was so short.</p>

<p>For me conferences are like family reunions. I get to touch base with people I haven&#8217;t seen in a while, and see how life is treating them. Many of my conference friends bring their partners along; many conference goers&#8217; partners are doing the same work they are.</p>

<p>We are a close knit tribe. When a day of talks is over at a conference, we go to dinner, we share drinks, we talk about what we are working on for work and what we are working on for fun. We stay up too late drinking in each others company.</p>

<p>So I get really upset when death and rape threats are made against someone telling Twitter they <a href="https://twitter.com/adriarichards/status/314002214022705152">felt uncomfortable</a> at a conference. I get angry when someone is <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dox">doxed</a>. And I get sad when someone <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SendGrid/posts/10151502570463967">loses their job</a> because… ?</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t what my corner of the tech world is, even on the bad days. The people I choose to work with make safe space for all. Maybe I&#8217;m naïve, but I believe our conferences and our companies should be safe places for everyone. For women, for people of color, for transfolk, for queers, sometimes they feel really unsafe. I&#8217;m glad that Codes of Conduct are becoming standard issue, and that conferences are focusing on increasing attendance for marginalized groups.</p>

<p>This work isn&#8217;t done. The work is never done. We can do better.</p>

    <id>http://make.bettermistak.es/2012/11/15/hold-cmd-q-to-quit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of Chrome&#8217;s features that I really love is the &#8220;Warn Before Quitting&#8221; option under the Chrome menu, which prevents the program from quitting with a message saying &#8220;Hold ⌘Q to quit.&#8221; displaying for a second or two before the browser closes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that feature only exists in chrome, and I have fat fingers everywhere. So last night I asked on Twitter, &#8220;Lazyweb: Any way to make Google Chrome&#8217;s &#8220;Hold ⌘Q to quit&#8221; (<a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2011/06/q-i-didnt-mean-to-do-that.html">Google blog post explaining the feature</a>) the default across OSX?&#8221;</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/perisaccadic">@perisaccadic</a> responded that KeyRemap4MacBook has that feature. I looked at the documentation last night, and KeyRemap4MacBook has a lot of key remapping features. Setting it to prevent quitting on accidental keypresses isn&#8217;t hard, but it isn&#8217;t obvious either. Here&#8217;s how you do it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/index.html.en">KeyRemap4MacBook</a> and restart your computer.</li>
<li>Go to &#8220;System Preferences…&#8221; under the Apple menu, and select KeyRemap4MacBook.</li>
<li>Under &#8220;Custom Shortcuts&#8221; select &#8220;Hold Command+Q to Quit Application.&#8221; There are a lot of menus under the &#8220;Change Key&#8221; tab, and I recommend using search box at top and just searching for &#8220;quit.&#8221;</li>
<li>Select the Key Repeat tab and adjust the &#8220;[Holding Key to Key] Holding Threshold&#8221;, which has a default of 200ms. I set this to 2000ms, as I want to have half a breath before I close my programs, your mileage may vary. This option is the third from the bottom.</li>
</ol>


<p>Then system-wide you&#8217;ll have to hold down ⌘Q, rather than bumping it by accident and losing whatever you were working on.</p>

<p>The effect has a diagonal border that follows the arrow as it juts out, and this is done by faking a border, a triangle with a z-index of -1 is placed below the initial triangle. The :before pseudo-element generates a 10px white triangle, while the :after pseudo element generates a background 12px grey triangle.</p>

<p>Not bad, but it&#8217;s pretty repetitive. Moreover, it&#8217;s hard to tell from the code that the video bubble&#8217;s arrow is on the top.</p>

<p>We can express this more clearly and succinctly. First we abstract out the arrow:</p>

<p>Nothing fancy is going on here, but taking a moment to get the structure in place and check that our math is clear make the next step easier.</p>

<p>It becomes a bit apparent at this point that we&#8217;re re-using a triangle pattern for both the arrow and it&#8217;s border. We can shake that out too:</p>

<p>It looks pretty good, and then we get another request… Can we make it so the the arrow comes out of the left side in some contexts, too.</p>

<p>First we put in the structure to accommodate a fourth argument, $position:</p>

<p>Then we can add another conditional for the left arrow, and voila a modular arrow giving our dialog boxes a speech bubble playfulness.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A business that chooses to train knowledge workers in whatever domain is in demand is likely to find that at the end of the day they have a competitive advantage. I think that you could start a small business today based solely on this principle and be a leader in your field within five years.</p>

<p>I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00850ZOKI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00850ZOKI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sibrar-20">Why Good People Can&#8217;t Get Jobs</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=sibrar-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00850ZOKI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> a short book by Peter Cappelli, and found his argument incredibly compelling.<sup id="refBody1"><a href="#refAnchor1">1</a></sup> For a variety of risk-averse reasons companies today make a practice of not filling job openings unless they have the perfect candidate. In the past, to fill a position which required special knowledge some companies would train promising candidates, but the nature of the jobs marketplace in the last few decades has made them overly-cautious of investing in training programs as they fear their employees will walk away after getting training.</p>

<p>For instance, a business that chooses to hire non-programmers and teach them to program will have a competitive advantage in their field. For this reason, based solely on the fact that LivingSocial started an <a href="http://hungryacademy.com">apprenticeship program</a>, I would place money on LivingSocial doing better than GroupOn in the next few years. LivingSocial recognized that without an influx of developers they wouldn&#8217;t be able to reach future business goals, and that it is cheaper to train devs than to (continually) recruit them.</p>

<p>I wonder if a web development consultancy cooperative could be formed based off of this insight. If you had a group of half experienced devs and half less experienced but dedicated trainees pairing together, you might find diamonds in the rough rather than paying market rates for diamonds. Of course, this sort of idea could be applied to any sort of business rooted in knowledge work, which is all of them.</p>

    <id>http://make.bettermistak.es/2012/05/20/birthday</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On my twenty-ninth birthday I got let go from the job I had been on for less than two months. I was hired on at a low rate to move files between servers, and I decided to write a PowerShell script to speed up the process. I improved productivity by an order of magnitude. As in, my project manager told me &#8220;the guy who was doing this before you would do in a day what you&#8217;re doing in an hour!&#8221; They were really excited to have me working so efficiently that they gave me a raise, and I was glad to be tweaking a shell script to do this. (Incidentally, if you&#8217;re in a Windows environment, don&#8217;t use your own shell script to do this, run robocopy.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;d been unemployed for a long while, and I was just glad to be working again. And on top of that I got to program a bit–sure Windows PowerShell wasn&#8217;t my preferred environment–but it was great to fix a problem with some code.</p>

<p>And then they gave me the call. I was working from home the day before my birthday, and I had ended up taking a long late lunch with my partner. I had a shell script running at home. I was on the bus home when one of the recruiters at the consultancy called me and let me know that this was my last day. I brought in my equipment the next day, and that was that.</p>

<p>The only jobs I&#8217;ve ever been let go from were ones I didn&#8217;t like that much in the first place. In this case I accelerated my departure from the project by doing the work very effectively.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;[Developers&#8217;] principal work is human communication to organize the users&#8217; expressions of their needs into formal procedure. That work will be necessary no matter how we change the life cycle. And it&#8217;s not likely to be automated.&#8221;</em>
–<strong>Peopleware</strong>, Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister</p></blockquote>

<p>About a month ago, I started working as a web developer for Contour. This is the job that I wanted a year ago. This is the job I was hoping for while I was teaching myself Rails while visiting my family in Guangzhou.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really glad to be working where I am, I like the company and my coworkers and I find the work challenging. I&#8217;m planning to take the steps I need to really level up in this role, including taking a nine-month <a href="http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/ruby-programming/downtown-seattle-autumn-2011/">night course on Ruby and Rails</a> at UW. I&#8217;m finding it difficult to find the time outside my forty-hour work week to focus on self-teaching, let alone finding the time to contribute to open source. (My apologies to Ryan Bigg, I haven&#8217;t been able to review much of <em>Rails 3 in Action</em> at all yet.)</p>

<p>This struggle between work and life balance, it&#8217;s to be expected, especially when you actually have a life outside of work.</p>

<p>This weekend I turned thirty, and celebrated with barbecuing, beer, backyard reading, blueberry scones, and a new backpack. I&#8217;m beginning to figure out what I want to do with the one life I&#8217;ve been given, and I&#8217;m really glad to be working a job that I like. The weekends go by so quickly, and the workweek seems to move even faster. I&#8217;m blocking the time I can to learning what I can. And I&#8217;m really happy that I convinced myself I could teach myself to code well enough to be a professional, I think that it&#8217;s going to be a really satisfying career.</p>

    <updated>2012-05-03T12:41:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://make.bettermistak.es/2012/05/03/how-to-create-a-local-sandbox-facebook-app</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note:</strong> this walkthrough only handles UNIX-y environments, like Linux and MacOS.</p>

<p>Facebook makes it easy to get started developing an app that integrates with their service, but I ran into a snag that confused me when I was trying to test my app locally. Here&#8217;s what I did to resolve the error below, which is thrown when you first try to log in on the Facebook Ruby-based app on localhost:</p>

<blockquote><p>{  <br/>
   &#8220;error&#8221;: {  <br/>
   &#8220;message&#8221;: &#8220;Invalid redirect_uri: Given URL is not allowed by the Application configuration.&#8221;,  <br/>
   &#8220;type&#8221;: &#8220;OAuthException&#8221;,  <br/>
   &#8220;code&#8221;: 191  <br/>
 }  <br/>
}</p></blockquote>

<p>To get started login to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">https://developers.facebook.com/</a> with your Facebook account and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Under Create a Facebook App, click on Developer App and Create New App, Name it (&#8220;Brony Finder&#8221;), Give it a Namespace (&#8220;og_brony&#8221;) and click the ticky-box for Heroku web hosting. I grumbled at having to provide a mobile telephone or credit card, and then moved on.</p>

<p>Select your environment and the email address you would like this Heroku app to be associated with, in my case, Ruby and strand@bettermistak.es. Your new app lives at <em>https://thing-stuff-1234.herokuapp.com/</em>. Mine was <em>https://electric-robot-2715.herokuapp.com/</em>.</p>

<p>Login to Heroku and head to &#8221;<a href="https://api.heroku.com/myapps">My Apps</a>&#8221; Click on general info and copy the git address under Git Repo. Go to the command line and in the directory you want the code to live in enter the following</p>

<blockquote><p>git clone git@heroku.com:electric-robot-2715.git <em># Clone your app.</em>  <br/>
cd electric-robot-2715/                          <em># Move into the app directory.</em>  <br/>
echo FACEBOOK_APP_ID=12345 >> .env               <em># Add your App ID to the local environment.</em>  <br/>
echo FACEBOOK_SECRET=abcde >> .env               <em># Add your secret to the local environment.</em>  <br/>
bundle install                                   <em># Install gem dependencies.</em>  <br/>
gem install foreman                              <em># Install Foreman.</em>  <br/>
foreman start                                    <em># Start Foreman.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser and click &#8220;Log In.&#8221; Oh no! you get OAuthException 191! This had me stuck for a few hours, and all I found were a few confusing Stack Overflow posts about it.</p>

<p>Facebook verifies that all requests for your app are coming from the right domain–they don&#8217;t allow requests from localhost or 127.0.0.1–and this info can be updated in your <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps">apps settings</a> under Hosting URL. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Add "local.herokuapp.com" to your Hosting URLs and save this setting. Then edit your `/etc/hosts` file so that local content is under the domain local.herokuapp.com. '>Add &#8220;local.herokuapp.com&#8221; to your Hosting URLs and save this setting. Then edit your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file so that local content is under the domain local.herokuapp.com.</span> This file is hidden, so from the command line enter <code>sudo vi /etc/hosts</code>. (Substitute your favorite editor for vi.) We need to use sudo, because this file is locked. Add the line &#8220;127.0.0.1  local.herokuapp.com&#8221; below &#8220;127.0.0.1  localhost&#8221; and save and quit your text editor.</p>

<p>Hit control-c and run <code>foreman start</code> again. Now test your app at http://local.herokuapp.com:5000/.</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

    <updated>2012-03-14T15:57:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://make.bettermistak.es/2012/03/14/the-rspec-book</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book</a></em> teaches how to build and refactor code using RSpec and Cucumber. I started it a few weeks ago, and set it down in preparing for my return to the States. I started it again last night and I&#8217;m glad that I was able to hook back in to the book even though I&#8217;d not looked at it or its code in more than two weeks. It is well written and approachable, written at a granular enough level that it is easy to set down for a while and not get lost when you pick it back up.</p>

<p>One thing that I am loving about The RSpec Book is that the chapters are short, and do a good job of guiding you through the process of building applications in a Behavior Driven Development style. Each chapter takes between twenty and forty minutes to complete, so even if your study time is constrained you can make some substantial progress.</p>

<p>At the moment I&#8217;m in the middle of the chapter &#8220;Refactoring with Confidence&#8221; in which the authors use a number of refactoring patterns outlined in Martin Fowler&#8217;s <em>Refactoring</em>. My roommate happens to have a copy, so I&#8217;ll be adding that to my reading pile and hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to find the time to start reading it soon. I am really enjoying the style of BDD, as its outside-in process helps me define the problem I want to solve, and guides me through the best ways to solve it.</p>

    <id>http://make.bettermistak.es/2012/03/08/realistic-goals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a little disappointed in myself for not posting anything in the last month.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been an exciting month too. My partner and I have returned to Seattle, and I&#8217;ve started working with mentors to establish myself as a web dev. I&#8217;ve been devoting time to studying an working on projects, and I&#8217;ve become a little more forgiving of myself if I fail to absorb all of the knowledge at once. In fact my primary goal at the moment is a simple and incremental one. I want to devote more time to working on projects and studying each week than I did the week before.</p>

<p>I think that is a realistic goal, because it assumes merely that I can do a little better than I did the week before, and I find it interesting that it is a relative goal as well. I had a realization a few weeks back when I was looking at a goal of reading a certain number of pages or working through a certain number of chapters. I found that I didn&#8217;t know what setbacks I would encounter, that it was difficult for me to estimate how much work I would be able to do in absolute terms, because there are always unforeseen roadblocks.</p>

<p>I can however, put in the time. So I&#8217;m going to try and work a little more every week and see what I can accomplish with a bit of incrementalism. I will eventually amend this goal to focus on increasing the quality of my work, but not until I&#8217;ve increased my weekly capacity from twenty hours of devoted work (which takes thirty to forty hours, I&#8217;m only counting the time my eyes are on the page or my brain and fingers are on the code) to about thirty hours a week. At that point I can be reduce certain less useful kinds of work but for now I just want to do better today than I did yesterday.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday an efriend direct messaged me: <em>What are you planning to do since you didn&#8217;t get into Hungry Academy? Just curious.</em></p>

<p>Good question.</p>

<p>I would like to find a junior web dev position, but the path from here to there is not clear to me yet.</p>

<p>My partner and I are looking at going back to the States, the culture shock has been especially rough for her and we both miss our community in Seattle.</p>

<p>On my window above my desk I have a post-it I wrote to myself yesterday, as a contingency plan for not getting in.</p>

<blockquote><p>If I don&#8217;t get into Hungry Academy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nicolemaddox">@nicolemaddox</a> for interview feedback and guidance.</li>
<li>Ask <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mathiasx">@mathiasx</a> to be mentors.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This has two parts with actionable steps that begin to chip away at two problems exposed by the HA application. The first problem is I have mediocre interview skills and this means that I only get mediocre jobs. Interviews are rare events that have a significant impact on my future.  Interviews are a game that I can increase my odds on, and I haven&#8217;t done a sufficient amount of work to get <em>really good</em> at answering questions like, &#8220;Where do you see yourself in five years?&#8221; An immediate next step to get better at interviewing is to solicit feedback from LivingSocial.</p>

<p>The second problem is I am still learning to code, and it&#8217;s going slow. I can continue to work on my own through whichever resources strike my fancy, but that&#8217;s a plan for slow-moving disaster. There are a lot of things I can work on, but I don&#8217;t have the judgement to know which things will be best for me at this juncture. An immediate next step to lay down the groundwork to improve my coding skills are to find mentors. Steve and Matt have both been awesome efriends, and I hope I can establish some checkins with them to ensure I stay on the right track.</p>

<p>Hungry Academy will be seeking applicants again, and if I&#8217;m on the market when they are, I will apply.</p>

<p>I also want to attend Ruby conferences, but there&#8217;s the chicken-and-egg problem of not having enough money to travel because I&#8217;m unemployed, and thus not being able to make the connections which could lead to employment because I can&#8217;t justify travel.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s looking likely that we&#8217;ll be back in Seattle before the end of February, and I will be looking for work to support our household. I hope that I can find a part time position to allow me to continue learning web tech until I am more qualified for development roles.</p>

<p>TL;DR Keep trying, hope I don&#8217;t run out of money too quickly.</p>

Doing nothing is often a big and repeating mistake. Aim to make your mistakes small and individual or iterating. Small mistakes give you faster feedback. Individual mistakes give you more unique experiences to draw upon. Iterating mistakes keep you on the path, but allow you to guide course corrections.</p>

    <id>http://make.bettermistak.es/2012/01/25/reading-list</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This was a jumble written on a plane, please forgive the incoherency.</em></p>

<p>Today I am flying from Guangzhou to Washington DC by way of Tokyo to interview for <a href="http://www.hungryacademy.com">Hungry Academy</a>. I feel like I haven&#8217;t updated this blog since I got to China. It&#8217;s been a very full January for me. The first two weeks here were culture shock and settling into our new home, the third week was minorly productive for me, I managed to study for 9 half-hour sprints before my aunt and uncle arrived in town for the Spring Festival.</p>

<p>I was also nervous as heck before my phone interview with Living Social regarding Hungry Academy. I managed to chat with them around 3:30 AM Saturday morning, China time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve touched down at Narita for two and a half hours, and thought it might be a good exercise to write out all of the books which I am reading at the moment and what I am getting out of them.</p>

<blockquote><p>  <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas — I&#8217;d read the intro to this several months ago and have been meaning to read it since. I&#8217;ve taken this plane ride as a chance to absorb it. I can tell already that this is a book that I will revisit as I advance in my career as a software developer.</p>

<p>  <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> by John Green — I&#8217;m a fan of Green&#8217;s YA fiction, as it handles the challenges of its genre extremely well, and aims to be fiction about young adults, not merely fiction to be consumed by a YA demographic. I just started his most recent novel which is about a young woman with cancer.</p>

<p>  <em>Non-violent Communication</em> by Marshall B. Rosenberg — My partner and I have been reading this book aloud to each other at night before bed. It aims to teach the language and practice of empathy for self and others. I have noticed that both my partner and I—we are both excellent communicators—have improved our empathic communication skills since we began reading it. I anticipate re-reading this book. Highly recommended for anyone who communicates in their day-to-day life</p>

<p>  <em>Them</em> by Jon Ronson — I read Ronson&#8217;s <em>The Psychopath Test</em> this fall and really enjoyed his pithy style and engaging non-fiction narrative. <em>Them</em> is an earlier &#8220;novel&#8221; about extremists in the late nineties and early two thousands. It&#8217;s not as good, as there is not as much connective tissue between the different types of extremists, but I look forward to seeing the parallels Ronson draws.</p>

<p>  <em>Rails 3 in Action</em> by Yehuda Katz and Ryan Bigg — Katz and Bigg do something very difficult extremely well: They have written an enjoyable to read introduction to Rails with a focus on test-driven and behavior-driven development using Cucumber and RSpec. This isn&#8217;t my first Rails book (that was <em>Agile Web Development</em>) but it&#8217;s the first one I &#8216;ve found fairly engaging. I could attribute that to a greater sense of patience with technical books, but I suspect it actually has to do with the pattern of development that the book is based around.</p>

<p>  The hidden bonus feature of this book is introducing you to test-driven development. Using Rails sometimes seems like a mystical art to me, but using Cucumber in particular has given me guidance as to what my next steps are. I will definitely be studying TDD in greater detail in the future, as introductory books lose me at times when they introduce how to do lots of things in a language or framework, but refrain from informing me clearly why I am doing it. The pattern of write test -> implement features -> run tests is infinitely reusable and will save me time as it leads me towards better practices.</p>

<p>  <em>Walden</em> by Henry David Thoreau — Classic book on holing up in the woods and living simply. Thoreau affirms my belief getting rid of my stuff or not getting stuff in the first place is one of the best things I can do to improve my spiritual and mental clarity. Choice quote: &#8220;As long as possible live free and uncommitted. It makes but little difference wether you are committed to a farm or the county jail.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on at the moment. I hope the interview goes well, and wish I&#8217;d been able to eat my uncle&#8217;s  <em>jiaozi</em> today.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>SEA -> BEI</h3>

<p>I am on the flight to Beijing, after having moved out of my apartment and stored boxes with family and friends. Last night was a late one, drinking cheap wine on a friend&#8217;s futon with my partner at two in the morning, letting the cheap wine soak our systems which were already coursing with caffeine from nine in the evening coffees.</p>

<p>This feels risky. Every part of my body says the safe bet would have been to stay in Seattle, find a job, any job, and work that for a couple of years till something better comes along. Something better isn&#8217;t coming along. Maybe I just wasn&#8217;t looking hard enough, but it looked doubtful that satisfying work was coming my way, no matter how hard I chose to look.</p>

<p>I did make one good stab towards my goals this week, despite the madness of moving. I finished my application to Hungry Academy, an apprenticeship program sponsored by Living Social with instruction by Jumpstart Lab. I posted my application video and a code sample. The video was ok, I did several eight minute takes and the last one felt good enough. The code sample I chose was a pull request wherein I had altered some of Brandon Mathis&#8217; code from the Octopress Pullquote plugin. There are very few alterations to the code, but it is the simplest solution that works, and this choice of project will hopefully demonstrate that I am capable of reading other&#8217;s code and adapting it. Also, able to contribute usefully to existing projects.</p>

<p>I really hope I get in, though the time commitment the program requires, along with it being DC-based might force my partner and myself to live apart for five months.</p>

<p>I reflected on last week&#8217;s goals and what worked and what didn&#8217;t I recognize that the thing that I need to focus on isn&#8217;t chapters or pages read (though these may end up as good metrics) but instead I should begin to focus on hours spent studying. I think that next week I will attempt to read <em>Rails In Action</em> for 12 hours. Which means I&#8217;ll need to read for two hours and twenty four minutes each day. I believe this is a completely achievable goal.</p>

<p>The other part to making this work is recording a metric other than time to see if I can improve. Though not all pages are equal, I&#8217;m going to track my page count, so that in the future I can improve my pages read per hour or day.</p>

<h3>On the Ground in Guangzhou, Day Two</h3>

<p>We arrived in Guangzhou late at night, 10:20 PM China time. We subtract sixteen hours to figure out the time in the States. it was 5:20 AM  back home in Seattle. We are exhausted from running through the Beijing airport after one of our bags disappeared. Both my partner and I had small meltdowns in the airport, and she barely slept on the plane. My brother and his wife pick us up from the airport and we cross into the new year while riding the Subway from the airport closer to their apartment.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a shopping day, including a long and exhausting trip to IKEA. We&#8217;re crashing in the extra room in my brother&#8217;s flat until we can furnish the apartment we&#8217;ll be staying at in the building above my brother&#8217;s brewery.</p>

<p>I think that acclimating through the jet lag and minor culture shock is going to leave me low energy, and it&#8217;s already Monday evening. I&#8217;m going to set a realistic goal of eight hours of reading this week, two hours each day Tuesday through Friday. I&#8217;ll set aside time and space away from my family to make this happen and hopefully also be able to check in at the end of the week.</p>

My project this week is to apply to <a href="http://hungryacademy.com/">Hungry Academy</a>. I&#8217;ll write a post before Friday to report how that went.</p>

    <id>http://make.bettermistak.es/2011/12/23/the-hidden-chapter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t read five chapters this week, and that&#8217;s partially because of the hidden chapter in all tech books. I believe the hidden chapter is a bug, but in documenting it I hope to make it in to a feature.</p>

<p>Tech publishing firms deals with different issues than other publishers. Tech books have small audiences which leads to higher prices per book as the economy of scale is the only thing that makes a paperback a possibly profitable prospect. (Though most books make very little. The secret of publishing is making small bets on unknowns and then creating and maintaining audiences for authors who find an audience with their first book.)</p>

<p>Tech authors aren&#8217;t paid much relative to the compensation they can receive if they work as consultants. I don&#8217;t have any info to compare their wage to authors in other sections of the bookstore, but anyone who has enough expertise to write a good tech book also has enough expertise to find better paying work elsewhere.</p>

<p>They also have to strike a difficult balance, being entertaining without being overly verbose, being informative without dulling the reader into a coma. I have been routinely surprised at how well written the prose is in tech books, and it comes from a high attention to detail on the authors part, as well as the early readers of the book, who are generally uncompensated.</p>

<p>To prepare a book for printing the publisher must work in rigid formats which preserve layouts and encourage migraines. There may be some editing staff that review the prose, but the publishing industry has scaled down heavily on copy-editors and other related quality assurance staff as the industry has digitized.</p>

<p>This is all to say, <strong>mistakes are made in tech books</strong>. They are to be expected.</p>

<p>However, a small mistake can have large ramifications for a coder just learning a new technology. I&#8217;ve been working through Rails 3 In Action written by Ryan Bigg and published by Manning Books. This morning at six, after a night of insomnia, I began working through the third chapter. My PDF was generated earlier this week, or it was delivered to me at the least, and I assumed that any known errata would already be incorporated. It turns out this is not the case.</p>

<p>Instead, I had an issue with using a version of Cucumber that had come out since the book was released and breaks the functionality of the code I was working through. The error got me confused, and I decided to take a rest. After a two hour nap and some veggie huevos rancheros, I tried my hand at it again. I figured out that my issue was related to using the wrong version of Cucumber. I tried a few things to fix the version issue on my current commit, but ended up having to revert to an earlier checkin with git. And that troubleshooting process took me a couple of hours where I would have actually worked through the material.</p>

<p>I believe that troubleshooting problems is an important skill to have. Mistakes in tech books encourage the reader to learn how to troubleshoot. But they also encourage frustration. I wish that there were a good, simple solution to ironing out errors from tech books, even those errors that are introduced by changing technology. From my understanding, Pragmatic Programmers has much better errata reporting system then Manning Books. Reducing the errors by using print-on-demand and continuous development helps a lot, but it will never be a silver bullet.</p>

<p>Those hours you take to troubleshoot something that should work, but doesn&#8217;t, are the missing chapter in most tech books. Try to look at them as value-added content. And publishers, please try to keep the missing chapters in the second half of your books.</p>

    <updated>2011-12-19T19:52:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://make.bettermistak.es/2011/12/19/new-habits</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I am going to set the goal of establishing two new habits, first I will post to the blog on Monday and Friday of every week. The Monday post will be about whatever my goals for the week are. The Friday post will be a review of how well I achieved my goals. The second goal is to read at least five chapters of my current development book, <a href="http://www.manning.com/katz/">Rails 3 In Action</a>.</p>

<p>Today I made it through the first chapter of Rails in Action, which was an overview of using rails with the scaffolding generator. Nothing too surprising, and near the end of the chapter my eyes started glazing over. Tomorrow&#8217;s chapter is about Unit::Test, RSpec, and Cucumber, Test Driven Development, all that. The writing is pretty good, Technical books have to strike a difficult balance in that their information to page count ratio must be high, but their tone shouldn&#8217;t be too dry, and if Rails in Action were a sandwich, it would have just the right amount of mustard.</p>

<p>Other things going on this week include packing and Christmas. My partner has sorted through all of her clothes and is giving away three quarters of them. Our rolling duffels will arrive in the mail tomorrow. We&#8217;re eleven days from flying out, and the limitations of international travel make me examine what I really <em>need</em>. Not a lot, it turns out.</p>
