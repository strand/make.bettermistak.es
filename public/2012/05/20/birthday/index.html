    <h1 class="title">Birthday</h1>
    <div class="entry"><p>On my twenty-ninth birthday I got let go from the job I had been on for less than two months. I was hired on at a low rate to move files between servers, and I decided to write a PowerShell script to speed up the process. I improved productivity by an order of magnitude. As in, my project manager told me &#8220;the guy who was doing this before you would do in a day what you&#8217;re doing in an hour!&#8221; They were really excited to have me working so efficiently that they gave me a raise, and I was glad to be tweaking a shell script to do this. (Incidentally, if you&#8217;re in a Windows environment, don&#8217;t use your own shell script to do this, run robocopy.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;d been unemployed for a long while, and I was just glad to be working again. And on top of that I got to program a bit–sure Windows PowerShell wasn&#8217;t my preferred environment–but it was great to fix a problem with some code.</p>

<p>And then they gave me the call. I was working from home the day before my birthday, and I had ended up taking a long late lunch with my partner. I had a shell script running at home. I was on the bus home when one of the recruiters at the consultancy called me and let me know that this was my last day. I brought in my equipment the next day, and that was that.</p>

<p>The only jobs I&#8217;ve ever been let go from were ones I didn&#8217;t like that much in the first place. In this case I accelerated my departure from the project by doing the work very effectively.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;[Developers&#8217;] principal work is human communication to organize the users&#8217; expressions of their needs into formal procedure. That work will be necessary no matter how we change the life cycle. And it&#8217;s not likely to be automated.&#8221;</em>
–<strong>Peopleware</strong>, Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister</p></blockquote>

<p>About a month ago, I started working as a web developer for Contour. This is the job that I wanted a year ago. This is the job I was hoping for while I was teaching myself Rails while visiting my family in Guangzhou.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really glad to be working where I am, I like the company and my coworkers and I find the work challenging. I&#8217;m planning to take the steps I need to really level up in this role, including taking a nine-month <a href="http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/ruby-programming/downtown-seattle-autumn-2011/">night course on Ruby and Rails</a> at UW. I&#8217;m finding it difficult to find the time outside my forty-hour work week to focus on self-teaching, let alone finding the time to contribute to open source. (My apologies to Ryan Bigg, I haven&#8217;t been able to review much of <em>Rails 3 in Action</em> at all yet.)</p>

<p>This struggle between work and life balance, it&#8217;s to be expected, especially when you actually have a life outside of work.</p>

<p>This weekend I turned thirty, and celebrated with barbecuing, beer, backyard reading, blueberry scones, and a new backpack. I&#8217;m beginning to figure out what I want to do with the one life I&#8217;ve been given, and I&#8217;m really glad to be working a job that I like. The weekends go by so quickly, and the workweek seems to move even faster. I&#8217;m blocking the time I can to learning what I can. And I&#8217;m really happy that I convinced myself I could teach myself to code well enough to be a professional, I think that it&#8217;s going to be a really satisfying career.</p>
